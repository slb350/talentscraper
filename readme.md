# TalentScraper - WoW Talent Build Scraper

This project consists of two parts:
1. A Python script that scrapes talent builds from Archon.gg
2. A World of Warcraft addon that displays these builds in-game

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Setting Up the Python Script

#### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

#### Installing Dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

#### Running the Script:
```bash
python archon_scraper.py
```

The script will automatically:
- Scrape talent builds from Archon.gg
- Generate a TalentData.lua file in the current directory
- No API credentials required!

### 2. Installing the WoW Addon

#### Directory Structure:
Create the following folders and files in your WoW AddOns directory:
```
World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/TalentScraper/
├── TalentScraper.lua     # Main addon file
├── TalentScraperUI.lua   # UI components
├── TalentScraper.toc     # Addon metadata
└── TalentData.lua        # Generated by the Python script
```

#### Manual Installation:
1. Create a folder called `TalentScraper` in your WoW AddOns directory
2. Copy `TalentScraper.lua`, `TalentScraperUI.lua`, and `TalentScraper.toc` into this folder
3. Run the Python script to generate `TalentData.lua` in this folder

#### Update Frequency:
It's recommended to run the Python script whenever:
- A new raid tier is released
- Major class balance changes occur
- The meta has significantly shifted

## Using the Addon

### Slash Commands:
- `/ts` or `/talentscraper` - Shows help
- `/ts show` - Shows the main window
- `/ts hide` - Hides the window
- `/ts toggle` - Toggles visibility
- `/ts refresh` - Refreshes current data
- `/ts boss [id]` - Shows data for a specific boss ID
- `/ts debug` - Shows debug information

### Automatic Features:
- The addon will automatically detect boss encounters
- It will show builds for your current class and specialization
- Warning will appear if you're targeting a boss with a suboptimal spec
- You can copy talent codes and import them directly into the game

## Troubleshooting

### Python Script Issues:
- Check your internet connection
- If scraping fails, the script will attempt direct pattern-based scraping
- The script includes delays to be respectful of Archon.gg's servers

### Addon Issues:
- Make sure all files are in the correct folder
- Check if the addon is enabled in the WoW AddOn menu
- Try `/reload` to reload the UI if the addon isn't working
- Use `/ts debug` to view debugging information

## Different Difficulties:
The addon supports Normal, Heroic, and Mythic difficulties, selectable from the dropdown in the UI.
